- Write each trade to Cosmos Db 
    - format: Trades -> urn:bittrex:btc-eth -> each trade
    - Id is tradeid from exchange?  Or nonce?  Some unique increment?

Trades ->urn:bittrex:BTC-ETH -> state
A class that stores state including "updated-to" field
Redundancy: periodic process that wakes, checks updated-to field, queries API for trades, and submits a bulk set of trades to a stored proc
Stored procchecks against whether record already exists
Perhaps returns records with a mismatch (missing, updated)
Stored proc updated the updated-to field
Since it happens in stored proc, operation is atomic

Second periodic process wakes on some interval
Calls a stored proc that scans trades that happened since last scan or completed candle
Writes new candles to candle table
Writes summary candle file that has last N candles within its json for fast retrieval
